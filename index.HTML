<h1>GOOGLE</h1>
<p style="word-break:break all;font-size:xx-large;font-family:monotype corsiva">Google is an American company that is most commonly known as a search engine.
Although the company made it’s name as a search engine, and the vast majority of its income comes from advertising because of this, it has branched out into a number of areas such as cloud computing, software and hardware.
</p>
<p style="word-break:break all;font-size:xx-large;font-family:monotype corsiva">Recently the company moved into the mobile hardware market by creating its first Google phone, called Pixel.
The cloud unit of the company is called Google Cloud, which contains things like G-Suite, the company’s productivity applications like Gmail and Google Drive.</p>
<p style="word-break:break all;font-size:xx-large;font-family:monotype corsiva">The company was originally founded in 1996 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page while students at Stanford University, California.
In 1998 the company was incorporated but then it held an IPO in 2004 to take it public again.
In 2015, the company announced its plans to reorganise its many interests as Alphabet.
Google is the leading subsidiary of Alphabet and operates as an umbrella to its Internet interests. Following the restructure, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google while Larry Page became CEO of Alphabet.</p>
